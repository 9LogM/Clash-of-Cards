# Project Overview

## Description

This project is a modified version of Cards Against Humanity, tailored for play on a single screen.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### General Rules

- **Number of Players:** 3 to 5
- **Initial Cards:** Each player begins with 6 white cards, each containing a different phrase.

### Round Progression

1. **Judge Role:**
   - The judge draws a black card that features a question or a fill-in-the-blank statement.
2. **Player Submissions:**
   - Players other than the judge select one of their white cards that best completes the statement or answers the question in the most outrageous way.
3. **Judgement Phase:**
   - All submissions are displayed anonymously. The judge reads them aloud and selects the most amusing response.
4. **Scoring:**
   - The player whose card is chosen earns a point and takes on the role of the judge for the next round.

### Additional Rules

- **Card Refresh:** At the end of each round, players draw one new white card to maintain a hand of six.
- **End Game Conditions:** The game concludes when any of the following conditions are met:
  - All predetermined rounds are completed.
  - A player reaches the target score.
  - All black cards have been used.

## Game Settings

- **Editions:** Choice between 'Family Edition' and 'Nerd Edition.'
- **Customization:** Players set the number of rounds and target score at the start of the game.

## Device Handling

- The device is passed among players for card selection, ensuring choices remain private.
- During the judgement phase, the device is placed in a central location where all players can view submissions without revealing their identities.

## Saving Progress

- **Save and Exit:** Players can save the game state at any time, which includes player names, their current cards, and scores.
- **Continuation:** Upon restarting the game, players are prompted to either continue the saved game or start a new game.
